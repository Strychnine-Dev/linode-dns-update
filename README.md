## Environment Variables

| Name          | Description                                                         | Required              |
| ---           | ---                                                                 | ---                   |
| LINODE_TOKEN  | Linode Personal Access Token with Domain Read/Write scope minimum.  | Yes                   |
| DOMAIN        | The Linode domain containing the hostname to be updated.            | DOMAIN or DOMAIN_ID   |
| DOMAIN_ID     | The Linode domain ID containing the hostname to be updated.         | DOMAIN or DOMAIN_ID   |
| HOSTNAME      | The Linode domain record (hostname) to be updated.                  | HOSTNAME or RECORD_ID |
| RECORD_ID     | The Linode domain record ID of the hostname to be updated.          | HOSTNAME or RECORD_ID |
| NODE_ENV      | Node environment, defaults to `production`.                         | No                    |
| LOG_LEVEL     | Log level, defaults to `info`. Other values: `debug`.               | No                    |

**NOTE:** To reduce API calls to Linode, pass DOMAIN_ID and RECORD_ID rather than DOMAIN and HOSTNAME for automated scripts.

**NOTE:** You can determine your domain and record IDs by running this script with `LOG_LEVEL=debug`.

## Docker

You can run this script as a Docker container by passing the required variables above.

```bash
# build the container
make build

# update your DNS record
make run LINODE_TOKEN=abc123 DOMAIN=mydomain.com HOSTNAME=myname.mydomain.com
  # or
make run LINODE_TOKEN=abc123 DOMAIN_ID=476 RECORD_ID=128
```

## Kubernetes (Helm)

You can install this script as a Kubernetes CronJob via helm. By default the job will run every 15 minutes, but you can configure your own values for the chart.

```bash
make install LINODE_TOKEN=abc123 DOMAIN=mydomain.com HOSTNAME=myname.mydomain.com
  # or
make install LINODE_TOKEN=abc123 DOMAIN_ID=476 RECORD_ID=128
```

## Node

For development, or to run the script outside of a container, you can run the script with Node.JS.

```bash
# environment
export LOG_LEVEL=debug
export LINODE_TOKEN=abc123
export DOMAIN=mydomain.com
export HOSTNAME=myname.mydomain.com

# setup
npm install

# update your DNS record
node app
```
